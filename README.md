# Roshanan Caf√©-Bookstore Data Analysis Project
Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp / Fall 2023

## üìå Introduction

Located in the historical heart of Shiraz, *Roshanan* is a unique caf√©-bookstore that provides an experience combining traditional beverage flavors with the intellectual pleasure of reading. Besides offering a variety of teas, syrups, and distilled drinks, the caf√© has a bookstore section showcasing a vast range of literary and historical books. An added novelty is that each beverage is accompanied by a QR code. Scanning this code reveals personalized book recommendations, often tailored to the specific drink chosen by the guest!

## üéØ Problem Statement

Despite the books being accessible to guests, the number of book-related transactions has been unsatisfactory. The caf√© management aims to refine their sales strategy and formulate special offers to enhance the revenue stream from book sales.
After preliminary investigations, they've identified three primary customer categories to target:

1. **Young Couples & Romantic Dates**: By showcasing books from top romance authors, the chances of these guests purchasing romance novels are expected to increase.
2. **Students & Researchers**: These frequent visitors can become loyal customers if presented with a curated collection of quality books at affordable prices.
3. **Foreign Tourists**: Placing stands of historical books from top publishers can serve as an enticing memento for tourists exploring the rich cultural heritage of Shiraz.
